# Ruby Substrings

Welcome to my Ruby Substrings project. This come from The Odin Project. It consist of creating a method taking a dictionary and a text in parameters, and he will count how many time appears each word of the dictionary in the text, and he will output a Hash with the result.

## How to use it?

To use it, git clone the project, then, in the terminal, go inside the directory and do ruby ruby_substrings.rb.
If you want to change the dictionary or the text, you will have to change directly the variable "dictionary" and "word" or "sentence" inside the code.
